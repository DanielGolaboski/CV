			<p>Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Islington, London, England, that plays in the top flight of English football.</p>
			<p>Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join The Football League, in 1893, and they reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division, and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history</p>
			<p>When Arsenal were first founded it was as Dial Square, which was the name of a factory workshop at the government munitions factory in Woolwich, southeast London and that is the story behind the nickname "The Gunners". They were effectively a works team formed by four friends at Royal Arsenal, but from those humble beginnings the present day club was born. The name of Dial Square didn't last very long, as it was soon changed to Royal Arsenal.
			Royal Arsenal didn't last too long either, as the club changed it's name to Woolwich Arsenal in 1891. The final name change came when the club moved to Highbury in north London in 1913, and since then they have just been called Arsenal. They moved across the road to the Emirates stadium in 2006, but thankfully no name change accompanied the move this time.</p>
			<p>The Emirates stadium has a capacity of about 65000 and is the second largest club stadium in England.</p>
			<p>Their longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbours, Tottenham Hotspur; matches between the two are referred to as North London derbies.</p>
			<p>Arsenal's tally of 13 League Championships is the third highest in English football, after Manchester United (20) and Liverpool (19). They hold the highest number of FA Cup trophies, with 14.[180] The club is one of only six clubs to have won the FA Cup twice in succession, in 2002 and 2003, and 2014 and 2015. Arsenal have achieved three League and FA Cup "Doubles" (in 1971, 1998 and 2002), a feat only previously achieved by Manchester United (in 1994, 1996 and 1999). They were the first side in English football to complete the FA Cup and League Cup double, in 1993. Arsenal were also the first London club to reach the final of the UEFA Champions League, in 2006, losing the final 2–1 to Barcelona.</p>
			<p>The squad went on a record 49 consecutive top-flight league games unbeaten from May 2003 to October 2004 and a record for an unbeaten top-flight league season earning the name "The Invincibles"</p>

					<p>Herbert Chapman  1925-1934</p>
					<p>Herbert Chapman always comes to mind when you think of Arsenal's best managers.

						The W-M, counter-attacking football and trophies were major parts of the Chapman era.

						The former Huddersfield Town manager made some great signings for players such as Charlie Buchan, Alex James and Cliff Bastin.

						While continuing to hone the team's style of play, Chapman led the club to two First Division titles and one FA Cup title.

						The attacking style of play is something still common in Arsenal's squad today and Chapman was influential off the pitch as well.

						Some of his innovations include changing the Gunner's jersey to the red body and white sleeve so common today and influencing the introduction of Arsenal as an underground station stop.</p>

					<p>Bertie Mee  1966-1976</p>
					<p>Bertie Mee brought Arsenal their first taste of European glory with an Inter Cities Fairs Cup victory over Belgian side Anderlecht.

					He also led the club to a First Division title and an FA Cup title in the same year and in doing so became the first manager to lead the club to a "Double."

					The Gunners didn't challenge for silverware regularly during Mee's era, but he did bring one piece of significant silverware that no other manager has matched.</p>

					<p>George Graham  1986-1995</p>
					<p>George Graham played for Arsenal during the Bertie Mee era and picked up plenty of silverware during his tenure.

					He returned to the club as a manager in 1986 and continued his success while leading from the bench.

					Graham led the club to two First Division titles, one FA Cup, two League Cups and one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup during his time in charge.
					He signed key players such as Ian Wright and David Seaman during his time at the club and fashioned a side known for its defensive solidity.</p>

					<p>Arsene Wenger  1996-2018</p>
					<p> Wenger is still consodered the club's greatest manager.

					His longevity, his trophy haul and the implementation of the youth program as well as the club's style of play set him apart.

					Wenger has led the club to seven trophies, four FA Cups and three League titles, and was extremely close to European glory on two occasions.

					During the 2003-04 season, he guided the side to a League title and an unbeaten season.

					He also created superstars such as Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and Cesc Fabregas, and oversaw the move to a new stadium.

					It's fair to say that Wenger helped raise the club's stature considerably with all his success early on.</p>

			<p class="player-name">Tony Adams</p>
			<div class="player-txt">
				When your nickname is "Mr. Arsenal," you know the people like you.
				Tony Adams was everything you want in a player, a leader and an all-time great.
				He was spirited both on and off the pitch. He was physically gifted and ultra-motivated. He was a hard worker and never became satisfied, appearing in 669 matches over nearly a 20-year stretch.
				He was success personified.
				And through it all, he remained hungry for more.
				Adams won more trophies than any other man on this list, and was at the heart of each of them. He was the rock of manager George Graham's defense, who called him "my colossus," and the do-it-all man at the back for Arsene Wenger, who later described him as a "professor of defense."
				His abilities went beyond defense, as well. He scored 48 goals in his career with Arsenal. Often bursting forward into attack, Adams helped along many an Arsenal goal.
				His abilities, focus, and leadership can hardly be overstated, and he was named the third best player in Arsenal history in a poll of Arsenal fans by Arsenal's website.
				He captained one of the greatest eras of Arsenal football, and his impact was and is immeasurable.
				His time at Highbury saw four League Championships ('89, '91, '98, '02), three FA Cups ('93, '98, '02), two League Cups ('87, '93) and a European Cup Winners' Cup ('94).
				It will be a long time before Arsenal sees another player of Tony Adams caliber.

			<p class="player-name">Patrick Vieira</p>
			<div class="player-txt">
				The best ever to grace the Arsenal midfield, Patrick Vieira was everything for the Gunners—he was the captain, the hub of the team and the player that made them tic.

The former Arsenal skipper led them to their invincible season where they went unbeaten. He was truly indispensable throughout that year.

The downfall of Arsenal football club can be linked to Vieira's departure—since his exit, Arsenal has failed to win a single trophy.  He won the Premier League three times and the FA Cup four times in his time with Arsenal.

He was the centre of the golden era for Arsenal football club, and even though he left for Italy after winning the 2005 FA Cup, he is still adored by the Arsenal faithful.

It was a fitting scene for his last ever Arsenal game, with a tight matchup against Manchester United which ended up going down to penalties.Vieira took the last penalty for Arsenal and  fired home with his last ever kick in Arsenal colours, winning the FA Cup and leaving with his head held high.

Even though he is now working for Manchester City as their football development executive, Arsenal fans will always have a soft spot for Vieira. He truly was the greatest Arsenal midfielder of all time.

			<p class="player-name">Dennis Bergkamp</p>
			<div class="player-txt">
				Words cannot describe this man.
				He was composed, ingenious, loyal, committed, influential, a great goal-scorer, an even better passer; you name it, Dennis Bergkamp was it.
				The cream of the talent-churning Dutch machine, Dennis Bergkamp was a one in a million player. Blessed and grateful are all who had the opportunity to observe this magician on the field.
				He transcended the game into something much more than sport. He transcended it into art.
				In 1995, Bruce Rioch, the temporary replacing manager after the dismissal of George Graham, signed Dennis Bergkamp from Inter Milan. It was to be catalyst in the transformation of Arsenal from a boring defensive side to a creative, attacking one.
				In fact, they signed a revolutionary. If Arsenal is now known to play beautiful football, Dennis Bergkamp must be known as the king of this kind of football.
				It’s hard to describe him and even harder for future generations to reach his level. Maybe it was his second to none first-touch, or his sublime technique, but most probably it was not only that. Many players have those skills and yet, cannot claim to have reached the status of Dennis Bergkamp.
				He had something else. An engine on alternative fuel: his brilliant mind.
				He saw things in his mind and could execute imagined moves perfectly with his technique. He had the potential and vision to paint masterpieces on the field. And he did, more often than not.
				What Dennis Bergkamp will be remembered for throughout the football world are not numbers, but the images that he has imprinted in everyone’s mind—images that exemplify what football class is.

			<p class="player-name">Tierry Henry</p>
			<div class="player-txt">
				Some players have done enough for their clubs and football to ensure they will never be forgotten by the fans—Thierry Henry has done more than that.
				Arsenal’s top goal-scorer has branded the club not only with his goals but with his attitude on and off the field. 
				A true gentleman, Henry created a bond with the fans that was cherished, and still is, from both sides.
				His Arsenal love story began when he joined the club to reunite with his former manager from Monaco Arsene Wenger, at the age of 22. Having showed glimpses of flair at Monaco and gone through tribulations of playing for Juventus in Italy, Henry found in his new club a paradise for development.
				Not long after his arrival to Highbury, Henry began to be recognized as one of the most feared strikers in the Premier League.
				On the green meadow, he was the player that teammates could pass the ball to and watch the magic unfold before their eyes. It was obvious he possessed that extra bit of talent that made him stand out from all the others. You just knew you were witnessing true class with him.
				While his football abilities bedazzled, he also possessed that much needed ingredient for achieving greatness—character.
				He had a funny side to him. He would often joke around with his team-mates and in interviews, which he seldom refused to give. But he knew when to be serious too. His communicativeness undoubtedly raised his influence, and after Patrick Vieira left for Juventus, he was the natural choice for the captain armband.
				Most of all, his conviction to help Arsenal achieve greatness was unwavering. It’s what separated him from many others. In a world of constant changes, it was hard to believe a player of such quality could place his loyalty in a club that was still growing.
				He wanted to see the club perform well and win trophies, and did everything in his power to help it achieve that.
				And he did help, quite enormously. He won five trophies while playing at the mythical Highbury – twice the Premier League and three FA cups. In 2006, Henry played a major role in Arsenal reaching the final of the Champions League, but his desire to triumph met a formidable obstacle called Barcelona.
				By that time, Henry had won everything with Arsenal, but the Champions League, the only trophy he had not, slipped through his fingers on that day. Ironically, he later snatched it with the very team that denied him the trophy in 2006 – Barcelona.
				By all means, he deserved it. His breath-taking skill beguiled and demanded recognition. It came in the form of every type of trophy there is— French League title, English League title, FA Cup, La Liga title, Copa del Rey, Supercopa de Espana, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Supercup, FIFA World Cup (club and international),  FIFA European Football Championship, even the FIFA Confederations Cup.
				Thierry Henry was bound to claim the status of a legendary player, especially in North London, where he gave the best years of his career and where he was appreciated for the great player and man he is. He became the club’s all-time top goal-scorer, surpassing Ian Wright, with an amazing 226 goals.
				Such achievement alone could grant him his place in the history of the club, but he walked that extra mile by showing his humane side. A legendary player comes once in a while in football. Arsenal was very lucky to have one that they could call their own—Thierry Henry.
				A tiny fact: Thierry Henry has never won the FIFAWorld Player of the Year award…
